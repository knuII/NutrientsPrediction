# HackCoVIT - Team Greenify

## #kisan badhega to desh bhi badhega

### Introduction

Team Greenify is on a mission to address a critical real-life problem statement: helping farmers quickly determine the nutrient content of their soil, compared to traditional lab methods. This not only saves valuable time but also assists in analyzing soil properties for future agricultural planning.

#### Collaborative Code
You can access our collaborative code on Google Colab: [HackCoVIT - Team Greenify Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14RDYsYKPD4axLqAQ4yMcJHWvvDCS5h1C?usp=sharing)

#### Dataset
Our project relies on the soil nutrient dataset, which can be found here: [Soil Nutrient Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h8mht3jsbz/1)
